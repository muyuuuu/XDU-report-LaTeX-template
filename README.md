# Intro

The latex template of experiment report, XDU. Note: The template is designed by myself which only adds basic items as required by my teacher. So, it's **not official**. I have came here for a month and didn't find a template with specific format. **Don't use this template if your teacher has a clear claim.**

The template's target is simple, applicable and easy to expand, so:

- In `.cls` file, the figure size and font family can be modified easily.
- You can imitate how the current items are added if you want add other items such as supervisor.

Here is the more details of the template: https://muyuuuu.github.io/2020/10/20/XDU-report-LaTeX-template/
